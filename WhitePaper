**Decentralized Business Ecosystem with Worker Protections & Incentives**  
**Version 1.0**  

---

## **Abstract**  
**Corporate Social** is a hybrid DAO-governed business model combining:  
âœ… **Tokenized profit-sharing** (TIC â€“ Tax-Included Coin)  
âœ… **Worker co-ownership & unionized protections** (LaborDAO)

### **Solution**  
**Corporate Social** creates a **self-sustaining ecosystem** where:  
- Workers earn **equity via TIC tokens** tied to profit/tax compliance.  
- Investors fund **local businesses** with clear ROI.  
- Disputes are resolved via **on-chain governance**.
